This post outlines my requirements for an effective cloud backup strategy and some challenges I&rsquo;ve run into. Future posts will evaluate some different backup applications based on my testing and describe the technical implementation in more depth.</p><p>One view I&rsquo;d like to promote is that everyone has important data, and it&rsquo;s worth the effort to plan for disaster recovery. In my opinion, the considerations and risks are the same whether you&rsquo;re an individual or a large organization. I hope these posts can be a resource for anyone looking for a reliable backup solution.</p><blockquote><p>For detailed steps, scripts, and results, you can follow along with the GitHub repo that accompanies this series of articles here: <a href=https://github.com/neapsix/cloudbackup-benchmarks>neapsix/cloudbackup-benchmarks</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id=its-a-series-of-tubes>It&rsquo;s a Series of Tubes</h3><p>My biggest challenge to backing up data over the internet is uploading a lot of data with only a little upload bandwidth. My cable internet connection from Charter is rated for 300 Mbit/s down and 30 Mbit/s up. In practice, I usually see a little less. The only other option in my neighborhood is a DSL connection, but at least I don&rsquo;t have a data cap.</p><p>Backing up a terabyte of data on my connection would take three days using 100% of my upload bandwidth the entire time. With incremental backups, I don&rsquo;t need to upload that much very often, but because the connection is <a href=https://youtu.be/f99PcP0aFNE>not a big truck</a>, the incremental process also needs to be efficient to avoid interfering with other traffic on the network.</p><p>The other challenge for me personally is puzzling out what backup client best meets my needs while being stable, trusted, and reasonably convenient to use and administer. There are a lot of options, and each has benefits and drawbacks.</p><h3 id=requirements-and-considerations>Requirements and Considerations</h3><p>I identified the following requirements for a good cloud backup process:</p><ul><li>Backups use upload bandwidth efficiently. This is measured in two ways:<ul><li>Backups don&rsquo;t disrupt users on the network. If the backup must run during daytime hours, a user should be able to have a video call at the same time without issues.</li><li>Each incremental backup is done before the next one is scheduled to start. Ideally, they finish overnight.</li></ul></li><li>Backups are encrypted prior to upload so that the cloud storage provider doesn&rsquo;t have access to the files (for a reminder of why, refer to <a href="https://twitter.com/Benjojo12/status/1373707799054712836?s=20">this tweet</a>).</li><li>The software used is well documented and easy to use. My NAS is already a <a href=http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/>pet, not a cow</a>, so shell scripts and helper utilities are fair game, but it should be possible for a friend or family member to recover my backups in an emergency.</li></ul><p>The following criteria are nice-to-have&rsquo;s:</p><ul><li>Backups are storage efficient and don&rsquo;t grow too much over time. Most cloud storage providers bill based on both the amount of data stored and the amount transferred, so storing more data costs more.</li><li>Backups are atomic (the data on the disk doesn&rsquo;t change while the backup is running). Ideally, the state of the cloud backup can be mapped to a specific ZFS snapshot.</li><li>The encryption method is confirmed to be reasonably strong, or a standard package like GPG is used.</li><li>The backup client is free and open source. I don&rsquo;t mind paying for commercial software, but if possible I&rsquo;d prefer to use a free or non-commercial tool.</li></ul><p>Of course, the backup plan must have well documented procedures and defined recovery point and time objectives (RPO and RTO), and those procedures should be regularly tested.</p><p>Note that I see cloud backups as a supplement to other methods. For example, a cloud backup might be the third copy in a 3-2-1 strategy (three copies, two local, and one offsite). I already run local backups by copying my data to a pair of USB hard drives using ZFS replication. Keeping one of the two drives at my office gets me an offsite backup, but the RPO with that strategy depends on my remembering to swap the drives often.</p><h3 id=next-steps>Next Steps</h3><p>With my use case and end state goal (the why and the what) defined, the next task was to figure out how best to implement them. Part II will list the options I considered and the steps I took to test them.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2021 Benjamin Spiegel</footer></body></html>
