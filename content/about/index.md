Hi, I'm Ben. I write about software for a living. On this site, I write about technology, music, photography, and more. If you'd like to get in touch, you can [send me email](mailto:someone@example.com) or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/neapsix).

This site is built with Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. You can find the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/neapsix/neapsix.github.io).
